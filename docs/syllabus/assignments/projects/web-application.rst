Web Application
***************

Build a Flask web app that creates both a broad view of data, and a user-specific view of that data. This is basically like building a bot or data visualization tool, except using the Web and HTTP as the input device.

Partners allowed, but if you partner up, you'll be required to create a project plan showing how the work was divvied up.
