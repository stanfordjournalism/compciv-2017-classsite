The for-loop is everything
==========================

My personal philosophy about teaching programming is that when a student understand how a for-loop works, and what it can do, then they've learned enough to become a very powerful programmer in the world.

This is the for-loop syntax in Python:

.. code-block:: python

    for x in [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]:
        print('hello world')


The more I teach though, the more I realize how much I've underestimated the depth of understanding needed to grok the simplest for-loop. There's no analogy to it in the real world for non-programmers to hang on to. They know what a repeating cycle of events is, but they don't know what it means to control the action in a loop.

I've been equally surprised at how many computer science professionals and academics don't appreciate the loop. I've come to learn that it's not the technical concept that is complicated, but the bigger picture thinking and personal reflection that is needed to understand how much of your intellectual work is purely mechanical and can be "looped"
