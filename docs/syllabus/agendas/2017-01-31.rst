Day 7: Tuesday, January 31, 2017 - Data serialization
*****************************************************



Assignment
==========

Last week's assignment has been split into 3 assignments due for Thursday. No quiz on Thursday.

Understand csv.reader, csv.DictReader, etc.
===========================================

Understanding how text is *deserialized* into data objects, and vice versa, is key to doing data work. If you can't turn text into data, you aren't going to get very far:

:doc:`/guide/topics/python-standard-library/csv`


JSON
====

JSON is just another data format, one that allows for data more complex that can be represented in a data row.


As far as we're concerned, JSON is a text format that gets serialized into Python dictionaries and lists  when we use Python's ``json.load()``. JSON's readability and lightness is a big factor in why it's the most popular data format for APIs today.

Example assignment from last year using Python's ``json`` library to deserialize the JSON responses from Google's geocoding API:

http://www.compciv.org/assignments/exercise-sets/0010-map-json-responses-set/


.. code-block:: python

    >>> import requests
    >>> import json
    >>> url = 'http://www.compciv.org/files/datadumps/apis/googlemaps/geocode-stanford.json'
    >>> resp = requests.get(url)
    >>> type(resp.text)
    str
    >>> mydata = json.loads(txt)
    >>> type(mydata)
    dict
    >>> mydata['status']
    'OK'
    >>> len(mydata['results'])
