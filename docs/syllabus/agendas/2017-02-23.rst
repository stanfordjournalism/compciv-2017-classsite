Day 14: Thursday, February 23, 2017 - Face the APIs
***************************************************

OK, one more day of fun-with-JSON, and downloading, opening, reading, closing files. But now we'll do it with Amazon APIs.


Face fun (pop quiz, etc.)

AWS, Access, and APIs
=====================

Today, we'll go over how to log into to Amazon Web Services and test out a few of the front-facing APIs, including:

- Polly: https://aws.amazon.com/polly/
- Rekognition: https://aws.amazon.com/rekognition/
- SNS: https://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/services/sns.html


I should be emailing you all in class with your keys/authentication, and we'll walk through the process of logging in, making calls to the AWS API, and just generally playing around. It is yet another example of dealing with serialized/deserialization of data, and tediously figuring out what data we want, and how, nevermind doing something useful with it.


'D' is for data, deserialization, and death
===========================================

Bummed that all we've done is download/open/close/read text files? I'm not going to argue that working with files is fun. In fact, it's one of the most painful things of any project, but exactly the kind of boring thing that a computer is perfectly suited for.

But the bigger questions are: Why files? Why text? Why 1 and 0 and True and False and other simple values?

The immediate answer is: because that's our best interfaces with computers, which otherwise think in 1s and 0s. If your goal in computational journalism is to find and expose and stop corruption/evil/inequity, then you will have to deal with the reality that those aren't self-evident when the information (the data, or what have you) is fundamentally just 1s and 0s.

The related question that we take for granted: Why do we write? Not just code, but anything? Why can't our societies' laws and traditions be communicated through oral tradition? Why isn't the beauty and power of Shakespeare's works as it was performed centuries ago enough of a contribution to human civilization? Obviously, because in-person experiences and words being shouted out don't *persist*. They aren't *portable* or *sharable*, and when they are, they don't usually keep their integrity.

It's not *wrong* to see writing as merely the ability to make dark marks on cave walls/parchment/paper. Of course there's more to it than that, if you know how to write, and you've ever committed your experiences to paper, and then had the experience of someone having their own interpretation




Caching
=======

Tangential reading: I realize I keep saying the word "cache" and will increasingly do so as we deal with remote data sources. Knowing that "cache invalidation" is one of computer science's hard problems probably isn't the most practical bit of insight. So here's a nice article from Wired explaining how cache design/implementation has similar concerns as properly organizing your closet:

For the purposes of this class and its assignments, when I talk about creating a "cache"



About the project
=================

If you're worried about the projects, don't be. They're just a way to do your own thing with what you've learned. It should feel easier and more interesting -- it's generally much easier to program when you know what you want to accomplish.


Another thing that should ease the stress: you only have to program the tasks and features that you know exactly how to do.

So for most people, I just assume this includes:

- Sentiment analysis.
- Natural language processing.
- Creating structured data from unstructured text.
- Extracting meaning from binary data, e.g. converting handwritten/photocopied text to actual text values.
- Non-supervised machine learning. Or any machine learning,r eally.
- Statistical learning, bayes analysis, or, really, any stats beyond calculating a percentage.
- Detection of fake news.
- Parallel/asynchronous/distributed programming.
- Mediocre-level error handling.
- Managing datasets too big to store on your computer.
- Pretty much all of web design/development, other than understanding that HTMl is just a text format.

Things that you either know how to do, or, just as good, know are completely possible for you to figure out *and* do:

- How to use the Tab key, because your brain is not meant to be wasted on preventing typos or memorizing arcane filenames.
- How to use iPython, and its interactive help features (such as help())
- How to use the type() function
- Writing code as if you're going to spend 10x more time reading/editing than writing it.
- How to use a function to wrap up a block of code, like variables wrap up hard-to-express values.
- There's no such thing as "close enough" when it comes to capitalization, punctuation, spelling, and the quoting of values.
- How to visit a URL in your browser or in a program
- How to describe what you want to find in text as a pattern (i.e. regular expressions)
- How to open a file
- How to read a file's contents
- How to make new folders and files.
- How to count things in a collection
- How to turn raw text into data structures using Python's libraries
- How to filter/sort/select data.
- How to find and read documentation for libraries and APIs.
- How to extract data from a dictionary or list.
- How to use a for-loop to do the same task, over and over.
- How to define branches/alternative routes of behavior with conditional statements.
- Where to find in an error message the exact line and type of problem.
- How to use a text editor, including saving and opening of files.
- How to run a program.
- How to see if a file by a filename


Prospective projects:

- A bot
- Likely a second bot (as a variation)
- A web application


Sorry, bottleneck is thinking of easiest route for "publishing" these projects, i.e. via your own remote server. Also, still debating on whether a web application should actually deliver web pages (i.e. requiring you to learn some HTML and care about design). Example user-facing/friendly web-project (Flask, Python) from previous years.

Don't focus on the design or interface as much as the story that is being told, more specifically, the filtering of facts from the raw data, and which facts and angles have been prioritized. Part/much of journalism is being able to take the same facts that have been covered elsewhere and still be confident

.. Thinking about bots
.. ===================

.. Next week, we'll spend our time making and deploying bots. It will happen in 4 phases, roughly in this order:

.. 1. Finding time-or-location-sensitive data sources to draw from, e.g. the daily temperature, USGS earthquake detection, Chicago shootings and homicides, officer-involved shootings, edits made to a Wikipedia page, federally licensed gun dealers, stock prices, city pay roll, activity in the latest Reddit threads, the latest Congressional votes, the members of Congress who represent a given locale, campaign finance contributions, latest filed patents, the latest by President Donald Trump, the audio/video feed of what's airing on cable news right now, Nicolas Cage's filmography.

.. 2. Writing/designing the stories that the bot tells: what does the bot say about the data, i.e. make it relevant to the bot's users/readers, i.e. how does it filter/aggregate/summarize the data, put it in context, and adapt the story based on hypothetical input (i.e. arguments to a function) given to the bot? e.g. today's temperature described relative to yesterday's, or to a rolling average over the past couple of decades, the homicide/shooting nearest a given location, a frequency count/density analysis of crime at a given location, a Google Street View of the officer-involved-shooting near you, the most popular/recent Reddit threads in all city-related subreddits, whether or not a popular image on Reddit has been submitted before, and by whom, a list of everyone who has favorited/retweeted your tweets/facebook posts today, that same list sorted in descending order of the user's popularity, a video stream showing the 30 seconds of CNN/Fox News/MSNBC broadcast prior to @realDonaldTrump's tweet, a text transcript of that video stream with proper nouns and other entities extracted, a list of NYT stories today that have nothing to do with Trump, a list of NYT stories today most likely to be seen and read by Trump, a Facebook "On this Day"-like notification, except based on events in Nicolas Cage's life.

.. 3. The bot's means of transmission, e.g. Tweet, SMS, web page, fax.

.. 4. The bot's trigger and inputs. What event makes the bot "say" something, and what information about that event does the bot accept as "arguments"? e.g. a regular time interval (every hour, or lunchtime every day), does the bot monitor a stream of data, e.g. Tweets for a specific word or phrase, edits on Wikipedia. Does the bot react to users, e.g. replying upon receiving a directed Tweet or email message, or when a user visits a URL endpoint in a web application. Or does the bot simply churn through a finite and deterministic source of data?

.. 4.5 Deploying the bot: if a bot is just a program that can run on a computer, can't we just run all of our bots on our own laptops? Sure. The concept of deployment, or the use of cloud servers, is just the complexity we tackle when we're tired of keeping our laptops on all day.
