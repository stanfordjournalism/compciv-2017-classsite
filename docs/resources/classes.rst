A short list of programming classes that overlap with the technical and philosophical bent of COMM 113/213.




Programming
===========


hap.py code:
    CS41: Stanford University

Python Programming for the Humanities
    Folgert Karsdorp
    `<http://www.karsdorp.io/python-course/>`

        The programming language Python is widely used within many scientific domains nowadays and the language is readily accessible to scholars from the Humanities. Python is an excellent choice for dealing with (linguistic as well as literary) textual data, which is so typical of the Humanities. In this book you will be thoroughly introduced to the language and be taught to program basic algorithmic procedures. The book expects no prior experience with programming, although we hope to provide some interesting insights and skills for more advanced programmers as well. The book consists of 10 chapters. Chapter 5 and Chapter 6 are still in draft status and not ready for use.
