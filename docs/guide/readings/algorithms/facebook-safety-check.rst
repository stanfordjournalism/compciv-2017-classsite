`Safety Check FAQ <https://www.facebook.com/help/695378390556779/>`_

    **How does Facebook know I'm in an affected area during a disaster?**

    To determine if you're in the affected area we look at a number of factors, including:
    The city you have listed in your profile

    Your current location, if you've given Facebook access to your phone or tablet's location

    Other signals that point to your location (ex: the city where you use the Internet)

    Once we’ve determined you’re in the affected area, we’ll send you a notification asking if you’re safe. In addition, we may prompt you to mark yourself safe if you've posted a status update about the disaster. If you don't want to share with your friends that you’re in the affected area, you can click I'm not in the area.

    Note: Once you're marked safe, only your friends will see your status, as well as any comments posted on your status.

    One of Safety Check's strengths is its ability to identify people who are likely in an affected area, collect their safety status, and quickly send that information out to friends and family. We want to reach people and spread the good news as quickly as possible.

    This goal immediately presented new challenges. Most products at Facebook are “pull” models, meaning we present some kind of experience when you open the Facebook app. Safety Check is a “push” model, meaning we proactively send everyone in the affected area a notification asking if they are safe


    The push model presents a difficult problem when launching Safety Check: How do we quickly find all the people likely to be in the affected area? Previous activations have ranged from a small city in Canada with only 60,000 residents to more than 20 million people in Ecuador after an earthquake. We needed an approach that could handle this range of population sizes with both accuracy and speed, but also remain stable and ready to launch at a moment's notice.

    Launched publicly in 2014, the Safety Check feature has been activated by Facebook 39 times around the world, from the Philippines' Typhoon Ruby in December 2014 to the Paris terror attacks in December 2015.

    In June 2016, Facebook began testing community-triggered Safety Checks, like in response to the Pulse nightclub shooting in Orlando and protests against police brutality in Charlotte, North Carolina. Users have triggered the tool themselves 328 times.

    The big difference in those numbers, Facebook argues, proves the company isn't able to know when to launch the tool every time it's needed.

    "We believe people closest to a disaster should play a bigger role in deciding when Safety Check is most helpful," Naomi Gleit, Facebook's VP of Social Good, wrote in a post announcing the change. "So today, Safety Check will be turned on by the community instead of Facebook."

Other kinds of alerts

`New Digital Amber Alerts Could Create A Backlash <http://www.npr.org/sections/alltechconsidered/2013/08/09/210417517/new-digital-amber-alerts-could-create-a-backlash>`_

    A couple of nights ago I had just closed my book, turned off my light, and was drifting off to sleep when my cellphone started to shriek. I shot awake and groped for the phone. My sleep-befuddled brain was greeted with this message: "Boulevard, CA Amber Alert update." Then there was a license plate number, and a make and model of the car.

    Groggily, I Google this town — Boulevard, Calif. — and discovered it was 541 miles away from my house. That's more than the distance between Washington, D.C., and Detroit. I was mystified. Why was I getting this?

    And I wasn't the only Californian who was confused.

    ..."This is a very powerful tool," Hoever says. "There were 164 Amber Alerts last year covering 204 children. Five of those cases are still open."

    But Hoever worries that sending these Amber Alerts to millions of mobile phones with little context could create a backlash. Right now the alerts are delivered on a dedicated frequency used only in emergencies. The messages are limited to 90 characters. There are no links allowed, no phone numbers and no pictures. It's a user interface that is hard to love.

    But it is easy to simply turn this system off by changing the notification settings on your phone. Hoever hopes most Americans won't do that. But he's worried.

    "When a child has been abducted, it is like trying to find a needle in a haystack," Hoever says. "The more eyes and ears we have out there searching for the child, the smaller the haystack becomes, and the better our chances are of safely rescuing that child."


`Abducted! The Amber Alert system is more effective as theater than as a way to protect children <http://archive.boston.com/bostonglobe/ideas/articles/2008/07/20/abducted/?page=full>`_


    ...Critics, however, measure the price of the program not in money but in broader social costs, in anxiety, panic, and misdirected public energy. Amber Alert and other measures "generate the appearance, but not the fact, of crime control," Griffin and Miller wrote. In so doing, such crime-fighting efforts reinforce misconceptions about what we should and shouldn't be afraid of.
