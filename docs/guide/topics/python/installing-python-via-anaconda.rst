Installing Python via the Anaconda Distribution
***********************************************

There are many ways to install Python. In fact, if you are on Mac OSX, your computer already has Python, albeit an old version that we aren't going to use.


The Anaconda Distribution, maintained by Continuum Analytics, aims to be a one-click way of installing Python just the way we (or rather **I**, your instructor) want it, regardless of your operating system or existing system configuration. It doesn't make any irreversible changes to your computer, and after the course, you can delete it from your system.

Hey Windows users, you too have a command line, also known as the **command prompt**. The reason why we haven't been using it because while it is a command line *interface*, the Windows shell is a different *language*. Things like the Unix **pipe** don't exist, nor do the commands have the same name.

That said, invoking the Python interpreter at the command-line works the same across all operating systems:
