If you've done a little programming, you already know how a single typo can completely derail even an otherwise perfectly constructed 10,000-line program. Less appreciated is how typos can change the destiny of the real, non-digital world.

From Slate, “Is This Something That’s Going to Haunt Me the Rest of My Life?”

    But a front-page New York Times article published Tuesday gave the story an almost incredible twist. The Times quotes Delavan as saying that he actually recognized that the email was a hoax—but mistakenly typed the word legitimate when he meant to type illegitimate. The implication was that the Clinton campaign was compromised not by incompetence, but by a slip of the fingers. The anecdote triggered headlines around the web: “A Typo Might Have Cost Clinton the Election,” gushed the Week.


That entire article is a must-read, both for its political implications, but also as a case-study in communication. For the purposes of *this* lesson, I just use it as an interesting example of *phishing*. Specifically, how Clinton campaign manager John Podesta was tricked into giving hackers access to his email account, which led to its contents being published on WikiLeaks and then becoming the focus of coverage for the 2016 presidential race:

An investigation by The Smoking Gun had details of how the phish was executed, including a screenshot of the email that was sent to Podesta (and many other political figures):

Here's a screenshot of the phishing email -- which targeted not just Podesta but journalists and other political figures, including the Democratic National Committee:
