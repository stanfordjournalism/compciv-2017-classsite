A spectrum of fake news
=======================


Obviously fake on its face

- https://www.theguardian.com/world/blog/2011/sep/29/the-onion-fake-congress-hostage-report


    Perhaps unnecessarily, the Onion confirmed its account had not been hacked, telling the Washington Post: "This is satire, this is how it works."




Fake, but requires research

`Drug Kingpin Joaquin ‘El Chapo’ Guzman Escapes Mexican Prison For The Third Time
 <https://web.archive.org/web/20170101022500/http://abcnews.com.co/drug-kingpin-el-chapo-escapes-mexican-prison-once-again/`

This was a fake story from a fake site. But it was effective because:

- It plays on the assumption that El Chapo was unbeatable, because his recent second escape was so dramatic.
- abc.news.co looks a lot like abc.news or abc.au
- It's a fairly nice looking website, enough to fool most people.

`No, El Chapo has not escaped from prison a third time <http://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-36748012> - BBC News; July 8, 2016.




Will fool some people

        The press release was circulated using an email address that appeared to belong to a real Pfizer spokesman, but used the domain pfizerinternational.com, a fake website that closely mimics Pfizer’s. That website, which also hosted the press release, has since been taken down. A Post reporter called the false phone number provided for the spokesman before the story was published and heard a message saying the company would not be answering questions about the press release and left a voicemail.

Essays about fighting/fearing fake news
=======================================

`Fact-Checking Won't Save Us From Fake News`_ by Brooke Borel (FiveThirtyEight)

I agree with professional fact-checker Borel that fact-checking is merely a "start", and probably more self-congratulatory than anything, because "some readers don't seem to care". And especially, her paraphrase of USC's `Mike Ananny<http://annenberg.usc.edu/faculty/communication-journalism/mike-ananny>`  that "fake news may be a fight, not over truth, but power".

I disagree with her that the problem is that news is "trying so hard to entertain", or that we should rely on Facebook or Google to alter their algorithms in favor of the news.
