> Algorithm for detemrining if this class is for you

Because so much of this class is about algorithms -- and I don't mean that in a fun TED Talk way, but in the most pedantic tautologically way sense that writing class is about words and sentences -- it's worth doing this class as a checklist. Keep it in mind when viewing the grading policy and the post mortem.


Do you know how to open a web browser, go to a webpage, click a link and download a file? Then congratulations, you already know how to do

Do you know how to:


Do you like:





Now, would you like to learn how to do those things, except in a in a 1970s-era interface, with each step taking literally hours to do the simplest case of, nevermind using in a useful program -- if you're hard-working and lucky?

Then this class is for you!

There's a little more to this class to fill the 10 weeks, but not much more. Keep that in mind when reading the grading policies and the post-mortem ("Why you hated and then dropped this class")

Why you will like this class

If you are a comsci
If you are a journalist

I think I do a genuinely good job of combining the two. There are much better reporters than me, and much better programmers. But there aren't many who tie the two things together.


- Pursuing stories with moral force.
-
- To create and sustan a sense of national urgency about the U.S. criminal justice system.

Post-mortem: Why you will hate and drop this class


## I hate teaching programming and journalism

Journalism and programming do not go well together. In fact, it's hard to think of two vocational fields that are so at odds. But let's use an example of code:


### Goldman sachs and donations


That's why I feel confident that, in theory, this will engage you. Even if the programming sounds really simple, it's useful to programmers unless you happen to be the programmer who has solved the 2 hard problems in computer science. Because we will be dealing with them a lot. That's what makes this class incredibly frustrating and filled with failure.

-------------

I don't actually want you to be a programmer. I don't want you to learn to code. This is the only way to learn the main benfit of code, which is: how information works. And how to see and work at scale.

We could make a bot without knowing much about programming.



This class is made harder than it needs to be. I could make it simply something about memorizing tools. But I want you to understand how a computer works. I want you to understand data. I want you to know why strftime exists. I want you to know about memory key handling and file systems. And because past students have really hated the focus on that stuff, this year we've added web applications, which means you will learn how to SSH and deploy across clouds in the machine, and of course, HTTP, HTML and what web design you can pick up to make a non-embarassing page. The difference between e and e. And you'll have to know some style guide.



Or to see things in scaling. Computational problems are computational. You'll still use your web browser, but you'll understand that the web browser is just an interface. And you will know



To see what little of our jobs is really about programming. Or thinking. When people complain so much about algorithms, are are they really complaining because it's new, or that they were just in the group of people who weren't in that class. When people say Fake news, is it because they really do know what fake news is? Or because they've been ignorant of what real news is?

Lower your costs
*****************

    Under Hamilton’s direction, the DeWitt Wallace Center hired leading journalists as professors of the practice, sought new economic models for news, and aimed to create new tools to lower the cost of investigative reporting – the mission of the center’s Reporters’ Lab, launched by Sarah Cohen in 2011. Closing the gap in data and news available to low-income people has been another area of focus for the center.

    ... lower the cost of delivering stories

Life is about showing up.
