TORONTO, Oct. 26—TransCanada Airlines unveiled this week an electronic reservations system that provides an up-tothe second inventory of all available seats in its fleet and completes reservations in less than four seconds.

An electronic computer with a built-in appreciation of airline economics is being used by American Airlines to calculate flight plans for its longe-range jets.

IT wasn't so long ago when Delta Air Lines was abuzz with dozens of projects to take advantage of the Internet revolution. It was in a consortium of airlines building an online exchange to buy aircraft parts. It was building a Web site that would allow frequent fliers to book their reward flights and was creating a system to beam flight schedules to Internet-ready cellphones. In the wake of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center and the Pentagon and the subsequent decrease in airline traffic, many of Delta's plans have been put off. Airlines are too busy taking planes out of service to worry about automating new purchases. And wireless gadgetry is hardly needed to keep track of half-empty planes.

WASHINGTON, April 6 (AP) — After several years of study, the scheduled domestic airlines have agreed upon a common, semiautomatic reservation system.

Algorithms in lining up:

The company was incredulous. The only way to accomplish that would be to get the After a year in business Southwest had still not established a ridership sufficient to sustain itself. When people phoned in reservations, there was no need to bother making a record of them. “Fine, sir, we’ve got you down!” a passenger would be told, leaving him blissfully unaware that Southwest didn’t even have a reservations system. By mid-1972 Southwest was in financial jeopardy. There was no choice but to sell a plane. In a fleet of four jets, that meant a 25 percent reduction in capacity. That, in turn, meant layoffs. Or did it? The employees of Southwest—many of them having been let go by other airlines, all of them thoroughly steeped in the company’s early fight against the odds—were willing to do just about anything to avoid layoffs. Some of them went to management with an extraordinary proposal: to maintain the existing four-airplane schedule with only three airplanes. The company was incredulous. The only way to accomplish that would be to get the planes in the air after they’d been on the ground only 10 minutes—an unheard-of feat. Fine, some of the employees said. We’ll turn them around in 10 minutes. Pilots and management supervisors were soon helping with baggage. Tickets were collected on board rather than at the gate. Each airplane was restocked with beer, booze, and soft drinks through the rear door while passengers were still deplaning through the front. Flight attendants worked their way to the front of the cabin as passengers exited the planes, picking up newspapers and crossing seat belts row by row, rather than waiting for ground handlers to come aboard.

The advent of jets in the late 1950s made efficiency in record keeping even more essential while also making it more onerous. The speed of jet travel encouraged more business and leisure travelers to fly on impulse, demanding even more up-to-date inventory records and faster communication. American tried to keep up by adding more terminals and more reservationists, but this only slowed the process more while creating, according to an internal company report, a cost problem of “alarmingly unfavorable proportions.” C. R. Smith was despondent.

As valuable as Crandall found such studies, he knew that computers held the potential to perform much more valuable functions for American. Computers, as he had learned at Hallmark Cards, could sharpen to pinpoint precision a company’s actions in the marketplace. They could be used as offensive weapons.

An airline seat is like fresh food—a grapefruit, say—in that it spoils after so much time on the shelf. Every empty seat taking off on every flight is a spoiled grapefruit and exactly as valueless. Both required time, effort, and money to create, and both came to a wasteful, meaningless end. And on an exceedingly large number of flights, the sale of one last seat, according to the First Rule of Airline Economics, could easily decide whether the plane flew the entire distance in the red or the black.

passengers with seats before the latter perished upon departure. The trick was to balance reservations against inventory, a far greater task than it might seem. At first, in the early 1930s, a single ledger had passed from hand to hand as agents in a central office recorded reservations and erased those that were canceled. With the advent of the DC-3, as the fleets and schedules of the airlines swelled and as the seating capacity of each plane increased, a single book became impractical, so multiple books were maintained. These had to be reconciled frequently—a massively time-consuming process—and even so, each book was inherently out-of-date at all times. Books gave way to chalk and slate boards and eventually to electric light boards. More and more agents were crammed into the reservations offices, with the line of sight to the blackboard limited by the space between structural support columns—22 feet in most buildings of the time. Some agents peered through opera glasses. Teletypes clattered. Clerks known as “card boys” scurried from desk to desk, eventually to be replaced by mechanical conveyors. One blackboard gave rise to multiple blackboards, which quickly encountered the same problems that multiple ledgers had caused. A science called “reservations theory” was born to cope with the exponentially worsening challenge, but to little avail; as with so much else in the airline business, there was no economy of scale in handling reservations. The more the airlines grew, the less efficient they became.

Airline schedules were published in a book called the Official Airline Guide. The OAG listed flights by city pairs—including connecting or “through” flights, as in Philadelphia to Buffalo through New York. Flights with the shortest travel time between any two points were listed first. This was a valuable display position, as years of history proved that the first flight listed between any two cities received the greatest number of bookings by far. Here, Crandall recognized, was a marketing opportunity. In one of his first presentations to the American board of directors, Crandall said he was establishing the tightest possible connections on through flights—not only as a way of getting people to their destinations sooner, but as a way of endowing more of American’s flights with listing bias in the OAG.

But Crandall quickly learned how deeply Sabre had slipped during the Spater years. On his first visit to Sabre headquarters, which had been moved to Tulsa, he was led to a basement and shown 1,000 cathode ray tubes sitting in their packing crates. The video screens had been ordered, paid for, shipped—and never so much as taken out of the boxes. They had sat collecting dust, held hostage for more than a year in a petty bureaucratic battle in which no one would release the funds to have them installed on the reservationists’ desks. While the computer revolution was raging throughout American industry, reservationists at American Airlines were still absorbed in the machine-gun clatter of their IBM Selectric typewriters, used as terminals connected to the Sabre mainframe. Staring at the sea of unopened boxes, Crandall could not believe his eyes. He immediately went to New York, pushed out American’s top data processing executive, and brought in an old friend from TWA. Crandall resolved to restore Sabre to its lost glory. There was no time to waste. The onslaught of technology was about to thrust Crandall into history’s first computer war—with the industry leader, United Airlines.

Under Carlson and Ferris, United’s in-house computer reservation system, called Apollo, had quickly become the jewel of the airline industry. While warily watching United’s efforts, Crandall was jarred by the disturbing news that the travel agents of the United States were taking steps to build a giant computer network, like nothing ever seen, a mechanism to display flight schedules and reserve seats on the airlines of the United States from any travel agency location in the country. The travel agents’ motive was plain enough. By the mid-1970s travel agents sold nearly half of all airline tickets. (The airlines sold the rest directly to corporate accounts and individual passengers—by phone, by mail, at airports, and at downtown ticket offices.) Travel agents had been multiplying like delis in Brooklyn, and in some cases they were assuming the same mom-and-pop look. Entrepreneurs, retired couples, wives of the wealthy—almost anyone could start a travel agency merely by stocking the Official Airline Guide and leasing some storefront space or a cubbyhole in a suburban shopping strip. Some people went

But what if the travel agents could go on-line? With a few keystrokes they would have instant electronic access to the schedules, eliminating the need to turn all those pages in the OAG. With a few more keystrokes perhaps they could actually place and confirm a reservation, eliminating unproductive telephone talk time. The agents’ proposal struck terror in the heart of Bob Crandall. In addition to losing control of the distribution system, the airlines, Crandall feared, would undoubtedly have to pay a transaction fee for every reservation they received through an independent computer network—on top of the commissions they already paid to travel agents. That was how any such network was bound to work; the electronic age presented profitable and exciting new ways to distribute products, but the unwary were sure to wind up on the losing end of the fee structure. Crandall vowed that in this case the losers would not be the airlines; with more than 200 million tickets written each year in the mid-1970s, a small fee could quickly add up to hundreds of millions of dollars in expenses for the airlines. The agents’ project, Crandall decided, had to be stopped. A big meeting of the American Society of Travel Agents, scheduled to begin only a few days later in Rio de Janiero, was the place to start.

Crandall wanted a way to punish TWA. All of TWA’s flights, as well as nearly every commercial flight in the United States, were visible in the Sabre terminals now being installed in travel agencies across the country. Crandall ordered one of his people to design a set of computer instructions enabling American, if it ever chose, to eradicate all traces of TWA from the listings in Sabre. Crandall wanted a single “transaction” designed, something that could punish TWA instantly, with a few keystrokes. The program was duly created. It would prove of great value, although not against the enemy that Crandall had intended.

screen. But how did Sabre, with its many mainframes and its millions of lines of programming, actually choose which flights to list on the first screen? The first line? How did Sabre decide which flights were most “convenient”? The answer depended on how one defined “convenient.” Sabre was programmed to score flights according to a formula based on the elapsed time of the flight, the proximity of the departure hour to the time requested by the agent, whether the flight involved a connection, and whether the connection involved a switch in airlines. The formula left great room for judgment, however, in the weighing of these factors. American promised travel agents that the best service based on these criteria would always be displayed on the first screen, regardless of the airline providing the service. But American made no such promise with respect to the all-critical first line, where, if it happened to serve those cities, the American flight invariably appeared. American’s salespeople promoted the virtues of selling from the first screen and the first line. “Trust the machine,” they told the travel agents, and the agents did, causing American’s share of the business in the local market to increase vastly. One study found that although American flew 42 percent of the seats between New York and Los Angeles, it got 60 percent of the business booked by travel agencies subscribing to Sabre. Between Baltimore and Chicago American had 25 percent of the total flying capacity but 44 percent of the bookings made through Sabre. In an industry in which a single market share point could make a huge difference in profitability, the marketing power of Sabre was explosive. “I would suggest we limit the results of this research to a need-to-know basis, since it could create some heat from our subscribers,” one of Crandall’s top aides wrote in a memo.
