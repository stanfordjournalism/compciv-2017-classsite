    Moreover, the school must rely on the honor system for compliance. It does not inspect personal tax returns, for instance.

    The book’s listed co-authors were Dr. Charles B. Nemeroff, chairman of psychiatry at the University of Miami medical school since 2009 and Emory University before that, and Dr. Alan F. Schatzberg, who was chairman of psychiatry at the Stanford University School of Medicine from 1991 until last year.

    Supporters of the Physician Payments Sunshine Act failed to take into account how expensive "sunshine" would be. Requiring drug and medical device manufacturers to publicly report virtually every payment they make to physicians, physician groups and teaching hospitals will end up costing far more than the $224 million estimated for just the first year of compliance. The biggest cost will be the valuable, socially useful physician-industry collaborations that simply won't occur.

    A 2011 study looked at 463 retracted publications and found that commercial sponsorship was not linked to an increased risk for withdrawal of manuscripts due to fraud or plagiarism.1 A 2006 study found that excluding FDA advisory committee members who had conflicts would not have altered the overall vote in any meeting that was studied.2

    "If there is no evidence of corrupt behavior, then what are we really after here? It's the appearance of corruption," says Lance K. Stell, PhD, FACFE, Thatcher Professor of Philosophy and director of the Medical Humanities Program at Davidson (NC) College and clinical professor of medicine at Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte, NC.

Not bad at first glance. However, on further examination, it’s clear that the list is nearly useless unless you intend to click through all 480 pages manually, or, if you have a doctor in mind and you only care about that one doctor’s relationship. As a journalist, you probably have other questions. Such as:

I’ll give them the benefit of the doubt that they truly want this list to be as accessible and visible as possible…I tried emailing them to ask for the list as a single spreadsheet, but the email function was broken. So, let’s just write some code to save them some work and to get our answers a little quicker.

> Only after exporting the Pfizer data to another computer program and analyzing it could The New York Times determine that the largest Pfizer payments had gone to Dr. Gerald M. Sacks, a Santa Monica, Calif., anesthesiologist and pain expert. He was paid $146,500 by Pfizer from June through December 2009 for “expert-led forums.”

    As Pharma Conduct has already been on the ball, I’ll defer to its analysis. It has some good background here on how lame pharma companies have been in past releases of data. Overall, Pharma Conduct is less-than impressed with Pfizer:

    Sacks, an anesthesiologist, isn't a leader in prominent pain medicine societies, and several top pain physicians told us they hadn't heard of him. He doesn't work in an academic medical center such as UCLA or USC. He hasn't published much research. We tried to talk to him about what he was paid for, but he didn't return numerous messages.

    Sacks' slides from a 2008 educational talk and 2009 presentation before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration describe him as the director of pain management at St. John's Health Center in Santa Monica. A hospital spokesman said Sacks has never held that title and that his pain clinic is not part of the hospital. He does have the ability to admit and treat patients at St. John's.

Alabama physician Mark Sweeny is not an academic, nor has he produced peer-reviewed research. He is on the staff of Decatur General Hospital's internal medicine clinic, but his board certification in internal medicine has expired.

He is, however, married to a Glaxo regional sales manager and since 2009 has earned at least $203,000 from Glaxo and another $52,170 from AstraZeneca.

Told about Sweeny's earnings, Dr. Larry Sullivan, Decatur's vice president of medical affairs expressed surprise at the amount, "Damn!"

Sullivan said Sweeny was "probably not" a leader in his field but "he's a good physician. He does a very good job." Sweeny doesn't need permission to speak on behalf of the industry as long as he fulfills his work responsibilities, Sullivan said.

Neither Sweeny nor his wife, Beth, the regional sales manager for Glaxo, responded to calls. Glaxo spokeswoman Mary Anne Rhyne said in an e-mail she could not comment "except to say that the decision to use Dr. Sweeny as a speaker on behalf of GSK was not made by a relative."

Another top earner, pain physician Gerald Sacks, declined several times through his receptionist to discuss his speaking fees. Since 2009, he has earned at least $249,300 from three companies.

Sacks' slides from a 2008 educational talk and 2009 presentation before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, describe him as the director of pain management at St. John's Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif. A hospital spokesman said Sacks has never held that title and that his pain clinic is not part of the hospital. He does have the ability to admit and treat patients at St. John's.

His private practice is busy, typically treating between 150 and 200 pain-management patients a week, he said while testifying on behalf of Xanodyne Pharmaceuticals before the FDA panel in 2009.

A decade ago the Minnesota Board of Medical Practice accused Dr. Faruk Abuzzahab of a “reckless, if not willful, disregard” for the welfare of 46 patients, 5 of whom died in his care or shortly afterward. The board suspended his license for seven months and restricted it for two years after that.

But Dr. Abuzzahab, a Minneapolis psychiatrist, is still overseeing the testing of drugs on patients and is being paid by pharmaceutical companies for the work. At least a dozen have paid him for research or marketing since he was disciplined.

    John C. Lechleiter, chief executive of Eli Lilly & Company, announced on Wednesday that starting next year it intended to post in an online database all its payments to doctors for speaking and consulting services. The postings will “likely include” the names of the doctors, or will provide some other identifying information about them, along with the reason for the payments, the company said.



https://www.justice.gov/archive/opa/pr/2009/January/09-civ-038.html

    American pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly and Company today agreed to plead guilty and pay $1.415 billion for promoting its drug Zyprexa for uses not approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Department of Justice announced today. This resolution includes a criminal fine of $515 million, the largest ever in a health care case, and the largest criminal fine for an individual corporation ever imposed in a United States criminal prosecution of any kind. Eli Lilly will also pay up to $800 million in a civil settlement with the federal government and the states.

    ...

    A Corporate Integrity Agreement (CIA) between Eli Lilly and the Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services. The five-year CIA requires, among other things, that a Board of Directors committee annually review the company’s compliance program and certify its effectiveness; that certain managers annually certify that their departments or functional areas are compliant; that Eli Lilly send doctors a letter notifying them about the global settlement; and that the company post on its website information about payments to doctors, such as honoraria, travel or lodging. Eli Lilly is subject to exclusion from Federal health care programs, including Medicare and Medicaid, for a material breach of the CIA and subject to monetary penalties for less significant breaches.

http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/01/business/01payments.html

    Pfizer is the fourth major drug company to make such disclosures, following Eli Lilly, Merck and GlaxoSmithKline. All four Web sites are searchable by the names of doctors or organizations, but all are set up in ways that make it difficult to download and analyze the entire database.

    “All of them are welcome, but none of them is a replacement for a single national database,” said Allan Coukell, director of the Pew Prescription Project, an initiative of the Pew Charitable Trust.

http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/13/business/13docpay.html

The money disclosed in such databases can be substantial. Pfizer, for instance, listed $35 million in payments to 4,500 doctors and 250 research organizations from June through December 2009.



At a price of $799 a month, the service also includes e-mail alerts whenever select doctors are reported. Mr. Dunston said four major medical schools and a number of hospitals have expressed an interest.

    Among the four leading drug companies making physician payment disclosures, Mr. Coukell said, Eli Lilly, which was the first to disclose, presents data as an Adobe Flash image, which he said was impossible to download or to sort. “They’ve gone out their way, I think, to present it as a Flash document,” Mr. Coukell said.


    Carole Puls, a Lilly spokeswoman, said the company purposely made its report impossible to download "to protect the integrity of the data." Lilly was concerned someone could change numbers and create a false report outside the company’s Web site, Ms. Puls said.


    Merck and GlaxoSmithKline display physician fees in Adobe PDF files, which must be laboriously copied if they are to be used in a sortable database.

Among them was Dr. Alan Yeung, Stanford's chief of cardiovascular medicine, who earned $64,000 from Eli Lilly & Co. in 2009 and 2010. Yeung was also the vice chairman of the Department of Medicine but left that position in February, Costello said. He declined to say whether the move was related to Yeung's violation of the policy.
