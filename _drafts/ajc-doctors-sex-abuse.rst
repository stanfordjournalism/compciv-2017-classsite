    As is often the case with investigative reporting, this series in The Atlanta Journal-Constitution grew out of other work. Reporter Danny Robbins was examining orders by the Georgia Composite Medical Board for his 2015 stories on prison medical care. In doing so, he saw orders allowing doctors to continue practicing after a finding that they had sexually violated patients.

    He compiled those orders, discovering about 70 cases clearly involving sexual misconduct. And in about two-thirds of those cases, he was shocked to find, doctors either didn’t lose their licenses or were reinstated after being sanctioned. That included doctors who had repeatedly crossed the line with patients.

    At that point, our data journalism team wrote computer programs to “crawl” regulators’ websites – a process known as scraping – and obtain board orders. This required building about 50 such programs tailored to agencies across the country. That collected more than 100,000 disciplinary documents. To assist us in identifying those involving sexual misconduct, we then created a computer program based on “machine learning” to analyze each case and, based on keywords, give each a probability rating that it was related to a case of physician sexual misconduct.

    We created a program that took what we knew about a physician — such as which states disciplined physicians on which dates — and identified possible matches in the public version of the data bank.

    We then examined those physicians individually against the more detailed information in our collections of data and documents to identify a possible match with a high level of confidence.

    On those occasions that we published specific disciplinary information about a doctor’s disciplinary record, we did so based on public records and other information that we collected as part of our reporting, not the data bank.

     No red flags were apparent when the Maine Board of Licensure in Medicine checked Dr. Jaroslav “Jerry” Stulc’s background in 2007. But within months of joining a hospital staff, the surgeon was accused of sexual misconduct.

     ...Stulc denied all the allegations, except the pornography, the charge on which the hospital took action. It suspended him with pay. Then, while he was out, the hospital and medical board learned that Stulc previously had been suspended by a Kentucky hospital following allegations of sexual misconduct and other disruptive behavior.

     Skirting federal rules, the Kentucky hospital hadn’t reported his suspension or subsequent resignation to the nationwide database established for hospitals and medical boards to share information on physician misconduct.

     Instead, just before Stulc applied for his Maine license, he and the hospital had agreed that he would voluntarily resign and never reapply for privileges. The hospital wouldn’t mention the suspension — or much else — to anyone who inquired.

     ...

     What’s more, the review found that even when hospitals and medical boards file reports, they may classify violations in a way that conceals the scope of physician sexual misconduct on the very limited portion of the data bank available to the public.

    Because of such gaps, the AJC — in reviewing board orders, court records and news reports — found about 70 percent more physicians accused of sexual misconduct than the 466 classified as such in the public version of the data bank from 2010 to 2014.
