# What is Compciv

It is our brutally short journey into programming and journalism.

A hybrid of computer science and journalism that takes the simplest parts of them in hopes of finding something of a greater sum.

We'll talk about algorithms, but mostly about how hard they are. 

There's not going to be a lot of big words. We'll read about algorithms, but we won't be using the word in class. And there won't be a lot of math. We won't be doing statistical analysis, other than converting `0.02` to `%2`. Arithmetic.


If you can hit a switch, then you can do all the computation need for this class.
--------

There is a coding requirement, but not because I expect you to be any good at programming, I just don't want anyone who hasn't seen code for what it is. Truth is, what we do will be far simpler.

The tradeoff is that you must know with 100% what you're doing. In code. And in journalism. So if you've only written really simple stories, or code, your reaction may be, "But I can only make simple things?" Then you have the right mentality to be a good programmer and a good journalist.

Our intent is to be very low-fi. While everyone hopes to imagine TNG, prepare for Battlestar Galactica

- Fail fast and fail happy
  - you won't know a lot of things


- Be like Apgar
  If you aren't able to reduce corruption or evil down to a problem of true and false, then it's a good sign that you might need to do some more research and collect more data.

- Text is the universal interface
  Everything is a text file. The biggest error by far is not opening the right file. Literally has destroyed companies. 


- Do one thing and do it well
  Simplifies programs. Is a sign that you know your problem.


- You will be reading code far more than you will be writing it.
  - Governs how we do style



- Tab or Die




# Our Short, Brutal, and Repetitive Journey



We will not get very far.

- Download a FEC file
- curl a FEC file and unzip it
- Put it into a script
- Now do it in Python
- Now do it in Python, but on a server that has about as much memory as your first iPhone:



# Why so brutal?

So all of that sounds fun, well, you probalby are just in the wrong class.

If it doens't sound fun, you're a normal person. That includes normal journalist. Normal com-sci/data-science student. It is as low-level as it sounds.

If during this process you feel like you should be having fun. Don't. Or an epiphany

----------

OK OK, so the journalism must be fun, right? Nope, it's actually even worse, all things considered. The low pay, not finding the story, not knowing if you screwed it up,a nd getting yelled at because you might have possibly etc. etc.

The programming is the easy part. And we will only get to doing the easy parts of the journalism.


----

These are true skills, I use them every day and would not ever consider doing journalism without them. I say that as someone who got into journalism to only do long-form writing and projects. If I got into a programming job, same deal. 

But this being a university this isn't just a skills class. If everything sounds so routine, the hard part is of course what comsci is hard. The non-deterministic, the non routine things. Life is full of those too, and connecting the two means thinking of Life, and all the important issues in the world as 1s and 0s. Assuming you're not a sociopathic Morpheus, this is something that requires true empathy, true research, and true reporting. Computers don't quantify life on their own.


-----------

On projects

The projects are the important thing. I don't want to have to baby sit you with your code when yous hould be doing real research.

If you can do the homework and the quizzes, then you can do the projects. But the projects help tie the info together. 



On cheating
What if you are someone who's smart, you already know how things are going, 
It's hard to dock you points for making that observation. That said,
