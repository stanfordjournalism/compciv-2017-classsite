Books
=====

- `Automate the Boring Stuff with Python`_ by Al Sweigart.
    The only reason why this isn't the required course textbook is because I didn't know how much Python I would incorporate this year. Otherwise, this is easily my favorite all-purpose Python book, both for its content and its mindset.

- `From Python to Numpy`_ by Nicholas P. Rougier.
    I'm not mathematically-inclined enough to use numpy (as opposed to pandas), but would recommend anything by Rougier.
